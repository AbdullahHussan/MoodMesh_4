# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

Changes: (1) Fixed MediaPipe Pose initialization - changed from 'Pose' to 'window.Pose' to properly access CDN-loaded library, (2) Fixed pose detection loop - removed isExercising check that was stopping the animation loop, now uses continuous requestAnimationFrame for smooth video feed, (3) Enhanced canvas drawing with color-coded skeleton (green=good form, red=bad form, yellow=neutral), added glow effects and better visibility checks, (4) Added comprehensive overlay UI directly on canvas: Top-left timer, Top-right rep counter with progress bar, Bottom-center form feedback with color-coded backgrounds (green/red/yellow) and icons (✓/✗/⚠), (5) Enhanced form analysis with better correction suggestions: Push-ups - checks back alignment and elbow depth, provides feedback like 'Keep your back straight' or 'Perfect depth!', Squats - checks knee position relative to toes, provides feedback like 'Keep knees behind toes' or 'Perfect squat depth!', (6) Added 'No body detected' warning when pose landmarks not found, (7) Canvas now properly sized (640x480) with green border when AI coach active.

GET /api/crisis/learning-profile/{user_id} auto-creates/retrieves profile. (2) POST /api/crisis/analyze-text uses Gemini 2.5 Flash to analyze ANY text (chat, mood logs, journals) comparing against user's baseline, detects both sudden spikes AND gradual escalation using moving averages, identifies personal triggers, calculates 0-100 escalation score, determines severity (low/medium/high/critical) and popup urgency, returns AI analysis with recommended actions, learns new triggers/coping strategies, updates profile automatically, has fallback to rule-based if AI fails. (3) POST /api/crisis/emergency-response provides comprehensive emergency resources: fetches user's close contacts (name/phone/relationship/email), returns country-specific crisis hotlines (US/UK/CA/AU/IN/International), generates AI-recommended immediate actions using Gemini based on context/severity, returns urgent message tailored to severity, provides follow-up resources. FRONTEND (3 new components + integrations): (1) EmergencyPopup component with severity-based styling (critical=red pulsing, high=orange, medium=yellow, low=blue), displays close contacts with call/text buttons, 'Add Close Contacts' prompt if none, 24/7 crisis hotlines with copy/call buttons, AI recommended actions, follow-up resources, blocking modal for critical/high severity. (2) useCrisisDetection React hook for universal crisis monitoring with analyzeText(), analyzeTextDebounced(), automatic emergency response fetching, popup state management, can be used across all components. (3) Integrated into AI Therapist (analyzes each message with conversation context, runs in background non-blocking) and Mood Log page (analyzes each mood entry, runs parallel to logging).

    message: "🚨 ULTRA-CONSERVATIVE EMAIL ALERT SYSTEM IMPLEMENTED! CRITICAL UPDATE: Completely rebuilt emergency email system to prevent false positives when alerting authorities. OLD BEHAVIOR (REMOVED): Email sent to authorities EVERY time emergency popup triggered, regardless of severity. NEW BEHAVIOR (ULTRA-CONSERVATIVE): Multi-layer verification with strict rules. ONLY sends email when ALL conditions met: (1) Severity MUST be 'critical' (high/medium/low never trigger email), (2) AND either explicit imminent threat keywords detected ('going to kill myself now', 'overdosing', 'about to jump', etc.) OR sustained critical pattern (2+ critical incidents in last 24h), (3) AND no authority alert sent in last 4 hours (cooldown period), (4) AND crisis text NOT 70%+ similar to recent alerts (prevents repeat spam). BACKEND CHANGES: (1) Created should_send_emergency_email() function with 4-layer verification logic, queries crisis_alert_logs for history, checks learning_profile for patterns, calculates text similarity, returns (bool, reason) with detailed decision logging. (2) Updated /api/crisis/initiate-call endpoint to call verification function BEFORE sending email, logs decision reasoning regardless of outcome, adds decision_reason to database records. (3) Enhanced send_emergency_email() with improved email template emphasizing verified critical status, professional formatting for emergency services. (4) All decisions logged to crisis_alert_logs with transparency trail. RESULT: Emails to authorities (currently abdullahdeveloper4@gmail.com, will be real emergency services) are NOW sent ONLY for genuinely life-threatening situations with high confidence. Medium/low/high severity users still get popup support resources but NO authority alert. Prevents alert fatigue and wasted emergency resources. Created comprehensive documentation in /app/EMERGENCY_EMAIL_SYSTEM_DOCUMENTATION.md. Backend restarted successfully. Ready for testing with various severity scenarios."
