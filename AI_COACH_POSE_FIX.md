# AI Coach Pose Detection CDN Error Fix

## Issue
User reported getting "pose.data in cdn not found" errors on the frontend when camera is in initial state in the AI coach section.

## Root Cause
The MediaPipe Pose library was trying to load model files (pose.data, pose_landmark.tflite, etc.) from a generic CDN URL without version specification. This caused issues because:
1. The CDN path was not pointing to a specific stable version
2. Model files might not be available or could change
3. No proper error handling for model loading failures

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated MediaPipe CDN Scripts (index.html)
Changed from generic CDN URLs to specific versioned URLs for stability:
- **Before**: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@mediapipe/pose/pose.js`
- **After**: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@mediapipe/pose@0.5.1675469404/pose.js`

Applied to all MediaPipe libraries:
- camera_utils@0.3.1675465747
- control_utils@0.6.1675465746
- drawing_utils@0.3.1675465747
- pose@0.5.1675469404

### 2. Updated locateFile Configuration (ExerciseTrainer.js)
Changed the locateFile function to use the same specific version:
```javascript
locateFile: (file) => {
  console.log('Loading MediaPipe file:', file);
  return `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@mediapipe/pose@0.5.1675469404/${file}`;
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
Added comprehensive error handling throughout the pose detection pipeline:

**In initPoseDetection():**
- Added try-catch wrapper around onPoseResults to prevent crashes
- Added success toast notification when AI Coach initializes
- Better error messages with specific details

**In detectPose():**
- Added check for pose.send method availability before calling
- Enhanced error logging to identify model data loading issues
- Added specific logging for CDN data errors
- Prevented error toast spam on every frame

**In onPoseResults():**
- Added null/undefined check for results object
- Added Array.isArray check for poseLandmarks
- Better validation before processing pose data

### 4. Improved User Feedback
- Added "AI Coach initialized successfully!" toast on successful init
- Better console logging at each step for debugging
- Enhanced error messages to guide troubleshooting

## Testing
1. Start an exercise session with AI Coach enabled
2. Camera should activate without errors
3. Pose detection should load model files successfully from CDN
4. Canvas should display camera feed with pose skeleton overlay
5. No "pose.data in cdn not found" errors should appear

## Technical Details
- MediaPipe Pose version: 0.5.1675469404 (stable release)
- Model files loaded: pose_landmark_lite.tflite, pose_landmark_full.tflite, pose_landmark_heavy.tflite
- CDN provider: jsDelivr (reliable and fast)
- Fallback handling: Graceful degradation with error logging

## Files Modified
1. `/app/frontend/public/index.html` - Updated MediaPipe script tags with versions
2. `/app/frontend/src/pages/ExerciseTrainer.js` - Enhanced error handling and locateFile config
