# üö® Voice Calling Setup Guide - Automated Crisis Calls

## Overview

Your mental health app now has **AI-powered automated voice calling** capability! When the AI detects emotional breakdown or crisis situations, it can:

1. **Automatically call** user's saved close contacts
2. **Use AI-generated text-to-speech** to deliver personalized crisis messages
3. **Call appropriate authorities** (crisis hotlines) if no contacts are saved
4. **Smart consent handling**: Auto-call for critical cases, ask permission for others

### 3. Trigger Crisis Detection

## üéØ How It Works

### AI Crisis Detection Flow

```
User sends emotional message
        ‚Üì
AI analyzes text (Gemini 2.5 Flash)
        ‚Üì
Detects crisis severity (low/medium/high/critical)
        ‚Üì
Shows Emergency Popup
        ‚Üì
User clicks "Call for Help Now" (or auto-calls if critical)
        ‚Üì
AI generates voice message
        ‚Üì
Plivo initiates calls to close contacts
        ‚Üì
Recipients receive automated call with TTS message
```

### Voice Message Example

When someone picks up the call, they hear:

> "This is an automated emergency alert. Your contact [Name] may need immediate support based on concerning patterns detected in their mental health app. Please reach out to them as soon as possible. This is a high priority situation."

The message is **AI-generated** based on the specific crisis context and personalized for each situation.

## üîí Privacy & Consent

### User Consent Handling

- **Critical Severity (suicidal ideation)**: Auto-calls without asking (assumes opt-in via app settings)
- **High Severity (severe distress)**: Asks user confirmation before calling
- **Medium Severity (moderate concern)**: Requires explicit consent

### Data Storage

All calls are logged in the database with:
- Timestamp
- Recipient details
- Call status (initiated, completed, failed)
- Crisis context (encrypted)
- User consent status

### Compliance

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Legal Considerations:**
- **NOT calling 911 directly** - this is for privacy and legal compliance
- Instead, recommends appropriate crisis hotlines
- User can manually call emergency services if needed
- All automated calls are to user's pre-approved contacts only

## üí∞ Pricing After Free Trial

### Plivo Pricing (Pay-as-you-go)

- **Outbound Calls (US)**: ~$0.02/minute
- **Phone Number Rental**: ~$1/month
- **Text-to-Speech**: Included

**Example Cost Calculation:**
- 10 crisis calls per month
- Average 2 minutes per call
- Cost: 10 √ó 2 √ó $0.02 = **$0.40/month** + $1 rental = **$1.40/month**

### Free Alternatives (Limitations)

There are **NO truly free unlimited options** for voice calling APIs. All telephony services charge because they use real phone networks. However:

- **Twilio Trial**: $15 credit (same as Plivo)
- **Sinch Trial**: Limited free credits
- **Vonage Trial**: Limited minutes

Plivo offers **best pricing** compared to alternatives (30-40% cheaper than Twilio).

   - Solution: Upgrade to paid account for international support
   
3. **Call Recording**: Available but requires webhook configuration
